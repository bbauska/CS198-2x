<h2>Course Syllabus</h2>

This course provides a wide overview of many of the topics relating to
and building upon the foundation of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. 

The course is divided into [6 modules]{.underline}: 1. Distributed
Systems & Consensus, 2. Cryptoeconomics & Proof-of-Stake, 3. Enterprise
Blockchain, 4. Scalability, 5. Anonymity, and 6. A Blockchain Powered
Future.

<h3>Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems & Consensus</h3>

> Blockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of
> computer science and distributed systems literature. We start out by
> providing a formal definition of distributed consensus and presenting
> foundational theoretical computer science topics such as the CAP
> Theorem and the Byzantine Generals Problem. We then explore
> alternative consensus mechanisms to Bitcoin's Proof-of-work, including
> Proof-of-Stake, voting-based consensus algorithms, and federated
> consensus.

<h3>Securing Incentives: Cryptoeconomics & Proof-of-Stake<h3>

> We examine the meaning and properties of cryptoeconomics as it relates
> to its two compositional fields: cryptography and economics. We then
> look at the goals of cryptoeconomics with respect to distributed
> systems fundamentals (liveness, safety, data availability) and the
> griefing factors and faults in the way of these goals.

<h3>Real-World Applications: Enterprise Blockchain</h3>

> We categorize the uses of blockchain and distributed ledger
> technologies, and look at various existing enterprise-level blockchain
> implementations, such as JP Morgan's Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and
> HyperLedger. We also explore business and industry use cases for
> blockchain, ICOs, and the increasing regulations surrounding
> blockchain.

<h3>Cryptocurrencies for the Masses: Scaling Blockchain</h3>

> One major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of
> scalability. We define scaling first as it relates to Bitcoin as a
> payment method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment
> such as credit cards. We then consider the general blockchain
> scalability debate and look into some solutions categorized by
> vertical and horizontal, as well as layer 1 and layer 2 scaling.
> Topics include block size increases, Segregated Witness, payment
> channels, Lightning Network, sidechains, Plasma, sharding, and Cosmos.

<h3>The Fight for Privacy: Anonymity, Mixing & Altcoins</h3>

> We look into the measures that governments have taken to regulate and
> control blockchain technology.  We examine Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
> and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, anonymity goals, and
> government techniques for deanonymization of entities on blockchain.
> Then from the user's perspective, we also dive into privacy oriented
> altcoins and mixing techniques.

<h3>A Blockchain Powered Future</h3>

> A summary of the entire Blockchain Fundamentals program and an
> exploratory look into blockchain ventures today, such as venture
> capitalism, ICOs, and crowdfunding. We conclude with a
> blockchain-based future thought experiment and explain the avenues for
> the student's potential involvement.

<h4>Notes from Rustie</h4>
Since Fall, 2016, Blockchain at Berkeley has been offering a course on
the fundamental concepts of cryptocurrencies and blockchain on UC
Berkeley campus. The goal was to create a survey of the blockchain space
that was accessible to anyone, no matter their background.

Our core curriculum, Blockchain Fundamentals, is split into two main
narrative "epochs," which roughly model the gradual maturing and general
sentiment about cryptocurrency and then later blockchain technologies.
This has translated nicely to the edX platform.

Our narrative starts with [Bitcoin and
Cryptocurrencies ](https://www.edx.org/course/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-and-the-crypto-space)explaining
cryptocurrencies as the first use case for blockchain, and Bitcoin as
the original inspiration. Our aim for this first epoch is to explore
both the technological and social aspects of Bitcoin, and then introduce
Ethereum towards the end, so as to dramatically reveal to students the
amount of intuition that carries over between understanding different
blockchain platforms at a high level. While the name of the epoch is
"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies," the primary motivation outside of
explaining what the title says is to decouple the ideas of Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies from that of blockchain. 

With the realization that their intuition carries from Bitcoin, a
cryptocurrency, to Ethereum, a more generalized blockchain platform,
students then transition into the curriculum's second epoch, [Blockchain
Technology ](https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-advancing-decentralized-technology)
The aim for this second epoch is to further expand the student's mental
model of what blockchain is. At this point, students are confident in
their understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, so in this
epoch, we start by diving into important big-picture technical topics.

That's where we are now, and we can't wait to get to know each and every
one of you through the discussions you start and the questions you
ask. Our vision for Blockchain Fundamentals was to surmount the steep
learning curve of blockchain and to create a space for students of all
backgrounds to collaborate and learn together. If you have any questions
or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask in the discussion boards.

On behalf of all of our amazing course staff, I'd like to officially
welcome you to CS198.2x Blockchain Technology.

We hope you enjoy the course!

Also, a good unofficial resource is the Blockchain at Berkeley Public
Slack, where we discuss various topics related to blockchain. You can
request access to our Slack workspace at the bottom of the [Blockchain
at Berkeley Website ](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/) under \"Join
Blockchain at Berkeley on Slack.\"

**Note**: the views expressed on the public slack do not reflect the
views of the instructors for this course. Official course discussion
should still occur on the edX discussion board.

**Major Contributors**

Blockchain Fundamentals started off as the [Cryptocurrency
DeCal ](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa16/)(Democratic
Education at Cal, student run) course on UC Berkeley campus in Fall
2016, taking inspiration from existing courses, videos, and textbooks.
From the beginning, the vision was to lower the barrier of entry and
provide a survey into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space \-- to
explain concepts from the ground up, as clearly and concisely as
possible.

Each semester since then, we have had many student volunteers take time
out of their already hectic schedules to help develop and fine-tune
content, to make Blockchain Fundamentals what it is today. 

Blockchain Fundamentals is constantly being improved, in terms of new
information as well as course design, but its vision has remained
constant. Here are some of the major contributors to Blockchain
Fundamentals, who have not already been featured on the previous page.

Gillian Chu, and Brian Ho.

## FAQ

Q: Are there any prerequisites to this course?

A: CS198.1x Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies (or equivalent knowledge) is a
prerequisite to this course. You can review all material from the first
course online for free or for a professional certificate.

Q: If this is a computer science course, why are there no programming
assignments?

A: There are many answers to this question. Firstly, computer science is
not programming, and especially for this course, we're operating at a
higher level of thinking. We'll be designing systems from the ground up
rather than being "stuck in the code." Additionally, to keep the
material open and accessible to students of all backgrounds, we have
designed the course to focus on fundamental blockchain thinking. 

It is, however, important to get your hands dirty and understand how
blockchain systems are actually built. If you are interested, we have a
separate curriculum, Blockchain for Developers, which we plan to port
over to edX in the near future. Recordings from our latest offering
(Spring 2018) can be found online for free at [Learn
Blockchain](https://learnblockcha.in/)

Q: Who is Blockchain at Berkeley?

A: Blockchain at Berkeley is a student organization on the UC Berkeley
Campus, dedicated to serving the crypto and blockchain communities. Our
members include Berkeley students, alumni, community members, and
blockchain enthusiasts from all educational and industrial backgrounds.

This course is a continuation of our first course, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies; if you haven’t already, please take a look at that course.
In the first course, we studied Bitcoin as the first use case for blockchain and examined its various components and properties.
We also looked at how blockchain is used for cryptocurrencies and generalized computational platforms, such as Ethereum.
By now, you’ve decoupled the concept of blockchain from cryptocurrencies to understand all the pieces individually and how they fit together.
This first week, we’ll be covering distributed systems and consensus algorithms.
You should be familiar with Bitcoin, one of the largest cryptocurrencies, and its use of Proof-of-Work to make sure everyone agrees – or comes to consensus – on who owns what amounts of bitcoin.
This is what Bitcoin accomplishes, but what is the underlying problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve?
Well, it’s truly a distributed systems problem: several computers, all unknown and untrusting of each other, are trying to agree on something.
Understanding the fundamental purpose and challenges of building distributed systems will give us the ability to understand the subset that is blockchain.
First, we’ll go over distributed systems fundamentals and the consensus problem, some tradeoffs and formalisms, and traditional literature in the space.
Then, we’ll look at Nakamoto Consensus, a new paradigm of distributed consensus, and examine how it fits into the traditional model of distributed systems, with a focus on Proof-of-Stake and other new styles of consensus.
After this lecture, you’ll be able to think about blockchain within the much larger scope of distributed systems and consensus.
Week 1 Announcements
Welcome to Week 1. Here's a quick breakdown of what to expect every week:
In general, each week will have 5 sections of video content and associated Quick Check questions. Quick Checks, as their name implies, are designed to be quick self-tests that you indeed understand the material. Quick Checks are graded on correctness, but you will have unlimited tries on each Quick Check question. 
The 1st week, we cover:
	Distributed Systems
	Voting Based Consensus
	Nakamoto Consensus
	Proof-of-Stake
	Federated Consensus

1.1 Intro: Distributed Systems
Let’s take a step back and think about the design and architecture of what we’re trying to achieve with blockchain.
What exactly are we trying to build, and how do we go about designing such a system?
With blockchain, we want to deploy it across a network, where users who potentially are located on different sides of the world can interact with one another.
We want this system to be distributed – a distributed system!
We want such a system to be able to agree on a common truth without trusting a single machine or authority.
In other words, we need the network to be able to reach consensus.
Instead of trusting the execution of individual processes or reliability of any individuals, we trust the general protocol and the math behind it.
It’s trust – without trust.
Luckily for us, distributed systems and the consensus problem have been studied for decades by mathematicians and computer scientists.
It’s by studying this traditional literature and design formalisms that we can start designing blockchain systems from the ground up.
Distributed Systems Origins
Before we explain what a distributed system actually is, let’s define a fundamental, age-old problem that pervades not only computer science and blockchain technology, but all of humanity.
How does a group make a decision?
Whether this be by majority opinion, general agreement, or force, how do we each consensus?
Consensus is trivial when we only have one actor.
I can always agree with myself on where to have lunch, but when I go out with my friends, we have to all agree on where to go first, and the process by which we reach agreement might be difficult.

In this example, my group of friends had to come to consensus on a common choice of action – what to get for lunch – before we were able to move forward – to actually get lunch.
